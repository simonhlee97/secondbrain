I'm hoping (but cautiously skeptical) that this little project turns into something that enriches my life in a majorly small way. But in all seriousness, maybe this will give me that extra boost of intrinsic motivation I need to continue the "growth mindset" that I've been trying to embrace for the past 15 years.

My only concern is that this project takes up all my free time.‚è≥

Most of the notes will be: interesting stuff I found in a book, article, movie, TV show, YouTube video, podcast, etc., as well as stuff I've learned.
